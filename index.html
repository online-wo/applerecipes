<h2>Apple Juice Benifits</h2>
<p>When apples are juiced, their hydrating quality is maximized, and some plant compounds are retained. However, juicing reduces other benefits of whole apples, including fiber and the ability to satisfy hunger.</p>
<h3>1. Supports hydration<h3>
<p>Apple juice is 88% water and tastes good. This makes it easy to consume — especially for those who are sick and at an increased risk of dehydration.

In fact, some pediatricians recommend half-strength apple juice — a mix of half juice, half water — for sick kids who are mildly dehydrated and at least one year old.

In a study of mildly dehydrated children with diarrhea and vomiting, those offered diluted apple juice were 6.5% less likely to need fluids delivered via their veins than those given a medicinal electrolyte drink</p>
<h3>2. Contains beneficial plant compounds</h3>
<p>Apples are rich in plant compounds, particularly polyphenols. While the majority of these compounds are in the peel, some from the apple flesh are retained in the juice.

These plant compounds may protect your cells from inflammation and oxidative damage. Both of these processes are underlying factors in chronic conditions, including certain cancers and heart disease.

In one study, healthy men drank a 2/3 cup (160 ml) of apple juice, then scientists drew their blood. Oxidative damage in their blood was suppressed within 30 minutes of drinking the juice, and this effect continued for up to 90 minutes (9Trusted Source).

For more polyphenols, opt for cloudy juice — which contains pulp — rather than clear, which has the pulp removed.

One analysis found that cloudy apple juice had up to 62% more polyphenols than clear juice.

The majority of store-bought apple juice is clear in appearance, meaning you can easily see through it. Organic varieties are more commonly available in the cloudy form.</p>
